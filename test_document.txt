This is a test document for the RAG application.

The document contains sample content that can be used to test the document upload and query functionality.

Key points about RAG systems:
1. RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
2. It combines document retrieval with language generation
3. Documents are processed and stored as vector embeddings
4. User queries are matched against these embeddings
5. Retrieved context is used to generate accurate responses

This test document should help verify that the upload and query features are working correctly.
